# Kernel Density Estimate clustering

This is Matlab code implementing a 2D Kernel Density Estimator using convolutions. This was used to identify clusters of crime for a project.

To run the code clone the repository and run the run_parzen_3.m to run the clustering algorithm.

The code also outputs a KML file that can be used to visualize the clusters on Google Maps.
