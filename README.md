# Kernel Density Estimate clustering

This is Matlab code implementing a 2D Kernel Density Estimator using convolutions. This was used to identify clusters of crime for a project.

To run the algorithm clone the repository and run "run_parzen_3.m". Play around with bandwidth and threshold parameters to see how the output changes. 

A KML file is also written to disk that can be used to visualize the clusters on Google Maps.
